1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.840
Trust is a promise.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.260
When our clients and colleagues

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.610
put their data in our hands,

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.990
they trust us to protect that data;

5
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.610
to keep the private, private.

6
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.330
To have a say in

7
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.770
how their information is collected,

8
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.290
used, or disclosed.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.380
To guard it from unwanted parties,

10
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.660
to follow laws

11
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.850
as well as company policy.

12
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.830
And when the time comes,

13
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.270
to dispose of it

14
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.500
so no one else can misuse it.

15
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.790
Our actions mean the difference

16
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
between total and safe data privacy…

17
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.390
And an unwanted marketing phone call

18
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.630
disturbing dinner…

19
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.070
Or junk mail clogging a mailbox…

20
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.290
Or personal information finding

21
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.920
its way into more dangerous hands.

22
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.300
We promise

23
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.510
to protect the privacy of

24
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.490
our clients and colleagues.

25
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.410
We promise

26
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.060
to follow our policies and laws.

27
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.650
When we uphold data privacy,

28
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.200
we protect ourselves, our company,

29
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.180
our colleagues, and our clients.
