<reveal>
<text>
<p>Data privacy rules apply to any information that can be used on its own, or in combination with other clues, information, or context, to identify, contact, or locate an individual. Data privacy rules include company policies, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), US federal and state law, and other region-specific laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Your name, address, and telephone number can all be used to uniquely identify you, as can your login and payment details for retail sites. </p>
<p>All this data is classified as personal data in the EU and personally identifiable information (PII) in the US. Unless you confirm that you are comfortable with your information being shared, a retailer should not pass your personal information to a direct marketing agency.</p>
<p>But it happens! Most of us have received unsolicited calls from organizations that have no good reason to be in possession of our name and telephone number. It's just one example of why we should maintain data privacy.</p>

<title>Thanks for helping John.</title>
<text>
<p>
<p>A newsletter preference is too generic to offer any reasonable chance of identifying an individual.</p>
<p>While the frequency of your purchases or the number of years you've been active with the company may seem too non-specific to help identify you, remember this: multiple pieces of personal data can be used to narrow a search to an individual.</p>
<p>It's important that you know what data qualifies as personally identifiable information (PII) in the US and personal data in the EU, and understand how various pieces of personal information can be combined to identify an individual.</p>

<text>
<p>
<p>Phishing attacks attempt to gain sensitive information by pretending to be from a friendly source. Be aware that official sources will never email or text you looking for login or account details. If you receive something suspicious, report it â€“ even if it appears to be from our CEO!</p>
<p>Don't delay in reporting technical issues. Interacting with a suspicious web page could likely result in identity theft â€“ and potentially more damage. If you are unsure who to report technical issues to, you can find out in the <span class="inlineComponentBtn" data-type="contacts" onclick="interface.openInterfaceComponent($(this), 'contacts')">Contact Details</span> section.</p>
<p>In addition, never forward personal emails to your work email, or to any third party. They could contain malware. Suspicious emails should only ever be forwarded to IT if specifically requested.</p>

<p>Ella now understands that introducing malware to our network would have huge repercussions. Because malware may steal workplace login details, such breaches place our company and our clients' data at risk.</p>
<p>Legal, financial, and reputational implications would result from an investigation and the subsequent publicity. Our information security systems would need immediate analysis and maintenance. This small breach could shut the company down!</p>
<p>Remember, it's important that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize the hidden threats that might breach our company's IT security or compromise the security of your personal information.</li>
<li>Protect your work email account by limiting correspondence to professional communications.</li>

<p>Employees shouldn't need an incentive to maintain data security.</p>
<p>Data must be stored securely and accessed only by authorized users. Policies must be in place to protect the anonymity of those about whom the data is stored.</p>
<p>Everyone must be trained in these policies. Security audits need to be completed on a regular basis. Documents containing personal data/PII must be shredded. When destroying electronic data, all electronic records must be securely purged in accordance with our company's retention and destruction schedule.</p>
<p>Privacy incidents are often the result of people making simple mistakes out of line with our policies. Our data policies exist to protect you, and us.</p>

<title>Thanks for helping Imran.</title>
<text>
<p>
<p>Imran now understands the importance of protecting personal data/PII and that data breaches can have severe consequences, including loss of reputation, fines, and even criminal charges.</p>
<p>Individuals may take action against any company, should it be identified that the company caused a data breach.</p>
<p>You have the right to hold accountable any company that is in possession of your personal information. Not following principles of proper protection of personal data/PII can have huge ramifications.</p>
<p>Under certain US laws, there are also reporting and notification requirements when a data breach has been discovered, including laws recently enacted in some states.</p>
<p>In the EU, under the GDPR, if a data breach occurs, the company responsible for the breach must notify the relevant regulator within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. Generally speaking, organizations must also notify individuals impacted, including their customers, without undue delay after first becoming aware of the breach.</p>
<p>Be sure to notify Legal if you discover or suspect that we have had a data breach, so that proper reporting can be done swiftly.</p>

<p>You wouldn't leave your credit card details lying around an open area would you? Or post your bank details on your Facebook page? No, because you know that you need to protect that kind of confidential, sensitive information.</p>
<p>Like you, our company needs to protect our confidential information and sensitive data. Any information you receive in the course of your work is private company information, and you are responsible for protecting it.</p>
<p>However, some information is particularly sensitive â€“ such as information that is not generally known in the industry, our intellectual property, or even our trade secrets!</p>

Classifying Information

<div>
<p>Assigning a classification level to information is the first step in protecting our information appropriately. Classification is a business decision based on how sensitive the information is. Once information has been classified, it must be correctly labeled so that everyone who works with it is aware of its sensitivity level.</p>
<p>It's up to you to know the classification of the information you are handling and to treat it appropriately. The classification identifies the security controls you need to adhere to so that you can protect the information.</p>
<p>There are four main classes of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public â€“ information that can be freely shared with any individual or group.</li>
<li>Internal â€“ potentially sensitive information that should not be shared outside our organization.</li>
<li>Confidential â€“ information (whether in oral, written, or electronic form) that may adversely affect employees, individuals, or our business if disclosed to unauthorized parties. For example, business strategies, marketing plans, manufacturing techniques, etc.</li>
<li>Restricted â€“ information that we have a regulatory or legal obligation to maintain and protect. Trade secrets are also sometimes classified as restricted information.</li>

<clickAndRevealItem catname="item1">
<click>
<text>
Email
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<p>Before sending an email, you should double-check the recipient before pressing the send button â€“ not only can it be embarrassing if a message is sent to the wrong person, but it can also result in the unintentional disclosure of confidential information about the company â€“ this may also be an infringement of data-protection law.</p>
<p>If you have to send an attachment that contains sensitive, confidential, or restricted information, you must ensure that the file is password-protected. Consider inserting the recipient's email address only once you are ready to send the email. You should never assume that internal or external messages are private and confidential, even if marked as such.</p>
<p>The Internet is not a secure means of communication, and third parties may be able to access or alter messages that have been sent or received. Do not send any information in an email that you would not be happy being publicly available. Matters of a sensitive or personal nature should not be transmitted by email unless absolutely unavoidable, and if they are, they should be clearly marked in the message header as highly confidential.</p>

Social Media Use
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<p>Be careful when using social media â€“ even when you are chatting with your colleagues; always remember the potential risks to you and to our company.</p>
<p>When you post a message using social media, you should assume you are making a public statement, even if you have set your "privacy settings" to only include known parties. Your messages will not be private and can be forwarded to third parties without your consent.</p>
<p>Once sensitive or confidential information (or offensive or defamatory information) has been posted, it cannot be recovered, and this may result in damage or liability both for the company and also you personally.</p>
<p>Never discuss internal, confidential, or restricted information on social media.</p>

Ensuring Confidentiality

<reveal>
<text>
<p>The confidentiality of internal communications can only be ensured if they are sent by internal company mail in a properly marked and sealed envelope, delivered personally by hand, or included in a password-protected online document, such as WINZIP.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances, should information of a confidential or sensitive nature be placed on the Internet. You should exercise the same care when using the telephone or fax, as when using email or other forms of written communication.</p>

Consult and Report
</text>

<p>If there is an incident such as the loss or theft of a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, this may constitute a data breach under data-protection rules, which may, in turn, need to be reported to a regulator â€“ in such an instance you must immediately report the incident. You can find out who to report to in the <span class="inlineComponentBtn" data-type="contacts" onclick="interface.openInterfaceComponent($(this), 'contacts')">Contact Details</span> section.</p>
<p>The loss of a device may also be a breach of a Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) or Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) applicable to another party's information on the device, which may need to be reported to the other party.</p>

<p>
<p>Choosing a classification level to apply your data is a business decision, based on how sensitive the data is. The more sensitive the information is, the higher the classification level and the more protection required.</p>
<p>When you classify information and then follow the rules that apply, you help protect our company in the event of a security incident. By following the rules, we will be able to prove to a customer, a regulator, or in a court of law that we have taken reasonable precautions to protect our data.</p>
<p>It's vital to ensure that there is a valid NDA in place before discussing information with a third party.</p>
<p>The Legal department can advise you if an NDA is already in place.</p>

<p>Audrey is working on a new project and needs to share confidential information with a supplier she's worked with in the past. There isn't a NDA or CDA in place with the supplier for the new project, and the project isn't covered by any previous NDAs or CDAs. However, as Audrey has worked with the supplier in the past, she is considering sharing the confidential information, as she trusts the supplier.</p>

<text>
What Should I Know About Sharing Information?
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<p>It's up to you to know the classification of the information you are handling and to treat it appropriately. Internal, restricted, or confidential information should only be shared on a need-to-know basis with authorized individuals or groups. When transferring data, always use the most secure and reliable path. Never transmit sensitive or confidential information by any method in an unprotected format â€“ use the encryption software authorized by the IT department.</p>
</text>
</reveal>
</clickAndRevealItem>
<clickAndRevealItem catname="item2">
<click>
<text>
Where Are NDAs and CDAs Required?
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<p>When sharing data with a third party, you may need to do so within the terms of a Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) or a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), in order to protect our company's information appropriately.</p>
<p>Therefore, make sure that a CDA or an NDA is in place before you start discussing our potentially sensitive or confidential information with a third party â€“ speak to the Legal department about this.</p>
<p>Here, "third party" means any outside individual or organization that you may come into contact with during the course of your work with the company, including potential, current, and previous clients, suppliers, distributors, business contacts, agents, advisors, and government and public bodies.</p>

<clickAndRevealItem catname="item3">

<text>
What Are Mutual CDAs and NDAs?
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
Sometimes, the other party may want us to sign an NDA before they share their company's information with us, so this would be referred to as a "mutual" or "two-way" CDA or NDA.<br/><br/>Failure to observe the terms of an NDA or CDA may constitute a breach of contract, so be sure that you are carefully following its terms.

What Are Our Responsibilities When Working with Contractors or Agents?
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
We are also responsible for ensuring that our contractors, agents, or anyone else acting on our behalf is handling information carefully, in accordance with any NDA or CDA.<br/><br/>You should only outsource services when you are satisfied that the provider has taken all appropriate steps to ensure that our company's confidential information will be protected and that our obligations under applicable CDAs or NDAs will be fulfilled.

When May Disclosure of Confidential Information Be Required?
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<p>Disclosure of confidential information may be required (or permitted) by law for a number of reasons. For example, some laws empower governments and other bodies, such as tax authorities, to require the disclosure of documents and/or information â€“ always consult the Legal department first before dealing with such an issue.</p>

</audioTranscript>-->
<clickAndRevealItem catname="item1">
<click>
<text>
Storing Data
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<p>Always store sensitive data, like restricted and confidential information, in secure files. Documents containing sensitive data must be kept in a secure location â€“ such as a locked cabinet â€“ and never left in open areas. All laptops and mobile phones must be locked away if left unattended overnight. However, in order to comply with data-protection legislation, do not store data for longer than necessary, i.e., data should be deleted when no longer necessary. For further information, you can find out who to contact in the <span class="inlineComponentBtn" data-type="contacts" onclick="interface.openInterfaceComponent($(this), 'contacts')">Contact Details</span> section.</p>
<p>Any devices you use to store sensitive data â€“ such as a laptop, tablet, or USB drive â€“ must always be password-protected and the data encrypted to an approved standard. You must not allow other members of staff to use your password. If you anticipate that someone may need access to one of your folders in a device in your absence, do not share your password. You should instead arrange for the folder to be copied or give shared access to the relevant folder.</p>
</text>
</reveal>
</clickAndRevealItem>
<clickAndRevealItem catname="item2">
<click>
<text>
Disposing of Data
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
Dispose of data according to the rules applicable to its classification. If you're unsure about the classification, always treat it as if it requires the highest level of protection.
</text>
</reveal>
</clickAndRevealItem>
<clickAndRevealItem catname="item3">
<click>
<text>
Special Considerations
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<p>Take special care when getting rid of confidential information, as this may lead to information being leaked, which may in turn constitute a breach of contract or a violation of data-protection law.</p>
<p>Too often, mistakes are made especially when throwing away hard copies of documents. Documents you are considering disposing of should be carefully checked for confidential information, subject to disposal terms under another party's CDA or NDA, as some require return of the information, rather than disposal; so improper disposal could be a breach of contract.</p>
<p>Also check for personal data â€“ destroying information earlier than necessary may also be a breach of data-protection law, so please check our policy before destroying confidential information. If you are unsure of our policy, you can find out who to contact with questions in the <span class="inlineComponentBtn" data-type="contacts" onclick="interface.openInterfaceComponent($(this), 'contacts')">Contact Details</span> section.</p>

Disposing of Confidential Information
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<div>
<p>When you dispose of confidential information, please ensure that you apply the following practical steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check the content of paper/hard copy waste that you intend to throw away (anything that contains confidential, personal, or sensitive information must be treated as confidential waste) â€“ dispose of it in accordance with the appropriate retention and destruction schedule or, if applicable, the terms of any CDAs or NDAs.</li>
<li>Shred hard copy information and place it in confidential waste bins.</li>
<li>Delete electronic data files and material held on USBs, DVDs, CDs, laptops, and PCs when they are no longer needed, in accordance with the appropriate retention and destruction schedule or applicable CDAs or NDAs. Where necessary, consider if this should best be destroyed by the IT department, such as ensuring the removal of confidential information from hard drives.</li>
<li>Always empty the recycle bin on your computer after deleting files.</li>
<li>Do not leave confidential waste bagged up where the public has access to it.</li>

Brazilian Data Protection Act (LGPD)
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<div>
<p>The LGPD is Brazil's main data protection law. In a nutshell, the LGPD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is concerned with personal data that can be linked to individual people, especially sensitive personal data about people's health, religious beliefs, political opinions, and so on.</li>
<li>Focuses on when and how companies process personal data in Brazil, which includes collecting, handling, storing, analyzing, using, or sharing that data.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are a processor who processes personal data or a controller who makes decisions about data processing, you need to do your part to keep people's data safe. By doing so, you can avoid fines or other penalties, and more importantly, you can help us preserve our most valuable asset â€“ people's trust.</p>

<clickAndRevealItem catname="item2">
<click>
<text>
When Can You Process Personal Data?
</text>
</click>
<reveal>
<text>
<div>
<p>According to the LGPD, you can only process personal data if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have consent from the data subject (the person whose data you're processing), preferably in writing. You must explain what you will use the data for, and people need to opt in actively, not by default.</li>
<li>You have a legitimate interest in the data. You must have a good reason for processing personal data.</li>

Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)

<text>
<p>The PIPEDA applies to private businesses like ours. It focuses on personal information, which is information about an identifiable individual. We need to protect people's personal information from accidental exposure or misuse by putting appropriate safeguards in place. We must be especially careful with information that might be sensitive and when we have multiple pieces of information about people. If we transfer personal information to a third party, we are responsible for how they handle it â€“ so we must make sure they know what to do too.</p>
<p>Your job is to help us keep Canadians' personal information secure. We have policies in place to help, but if you see any issues, please tell your team leader so that we can do better. </p>

<li>We have privacy policies that lay out how we will collect, use, and disclose this information.</li>
<li>In our privacy policies, we disclose how long we will store information, when we will share it with third parties, and how people can access their information.</li>
<li>We appoint a person â€“ often called the Data Privacy Officer (DPO) â€“ who will be responsible for making sure we do the right thing when it comes to personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Our main responsibility is to keep private information private â€“ that means avoiding data breaches and ensuring information isn't shared inappropriately. We must also only use the information for the purpose identified in our privacy policies.</p>

Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)

<p>The PIPL is China's main privacy law. It's focused on protecting people's personal information and safeguarding China's national security and the public interest.</p>
<p>The PIPL defines personal information as any recorded information about an identifiable person. The PIPL is particularly concerned with sensitive personal information, which is information that, if leaked or misused, would embarrass a person or endanger their safety or their property.</p>
<p>The PIPL covers data handling â€“ which means the collection, storage, use, processing, transmission, publishing, and other treatment of information. It applies to any data handling of personal information inside China, as well as outside China when it's aimed at providing products or services to people in China, or analyzing the behavior of Chinese people.</p>

<li>The Chinese Data Security Law, which is focused on data safety and security, especially of information that could endanger China's national security or the public interest of Chinese citizens.</li>

Key Considerations

<reveal>
<text>
<div>
<p>The PIPL allows businesses like ours to use personal data, as long as we have consent, or we need to use the information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To enter a contract with the person concerned, or for human resources management, or collective labor contracts purposes.</li>
<li>To fulfill our legal responsibilities or obligations.</li>
<li>To respond to a public health or other emergency.</li>
<li>To carry out news reporting or media monitoring that is in the public interest.</li>
<li>To process data that individuals disclose themselves, within reason.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We need additional consent if we plan to share the personal information that we collect with a third party, publicly disclose it, or transfer it outside of China. We also need separate consent for handling sensitive personal information.</p>

Those rights include the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know what information we collect.</li>
<li>Limit or refuse permission for others to handle, access, or copy their information.</li>
<li>Request corrections or deletion of their information.</li>

<p>The APPI focuses on personal information, which is information about living people in Japan that could be used to identify them. It's also concerned with sensitive personal information, which is information about race, religion, health status, and any other potentially sensitive topics.</p>
<p>Whenever you work with personal information or sensitive personal information about Japanese customers, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the information is kept confidential and stored securely.</li>
<li>Use the information only in ways that are specified in our company policy.</li>
<li>Avoid transferring the information outside Japan without people's consent.</li>

<p>It is your duty to know what personal and protected information is, how to identify it and keep it safe, and what to do in the event of a disclosure or a security incident.</p>
<p>You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report breaches of data security via the appropriate channels. If you don't know what the appropriate channels are, you can find out in the <span class="inlineComponentBtn" data-type="contacts" onclick="interface.openInterfaceComponent($(this), 'contacts')">Contact Details</span> section.</li>
<li>Use personal data/personally identifiable information (PII) only in a manner consistent with the purpose for which it is obtained.</li>
<li>Store data only for as long as is necessary.</li>
<li>Encrypt personal data/PII whenever it is stored.</li>
<li>Remember that personal data/PII should only be used and stored in a controlled environment. Taking such data off-premises should be avoided.</li>
<li>Be aware that failure to protect personal data/PII can result in significant fines and reputational damage.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Remember, it's your responsibility to speak up if you become aware of any potential or actual violations of privacy law or company policy. Make sure you know to whom to direct your questions and to whom to report concerns. Company policy prohibits retaliation for raising concerns and protects you when you speak up, as well as when you cooperate with investigations.
